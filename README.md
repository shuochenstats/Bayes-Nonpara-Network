# Bayes-Nonpara-Network

matlab code
The zipped file include a data set and the MCMC codes to estimate the dependence structure of connectivity edges at a population level. The data set consist 60 subjects, and each subject has a 90x90 connectivity matrix.

The Bayes nonparametric model is used to estimate the dependence structure by taking the network topology into account.
